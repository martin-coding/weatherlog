# Weatherlog
Webserver application to log weather readings

## Educational project
This project is my first web application focusing on backend using NodeJS and express.\
Have fun looking at the shitty code.

## Setup

1. Start database with `docker compose up -d`
2. Rename `.env_example` to `.env` and make changes if necessary
3. Start application with `npm run start`
